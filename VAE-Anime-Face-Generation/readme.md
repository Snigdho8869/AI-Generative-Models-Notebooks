# VAE Anime Face Generation

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook for generating anime-style faces using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

## Overview

In this notebook, I demonstrate the process of generating anime faces using a Variational Autoencoder. The VAE is a generative model that can produce high-quality anime face images. The VAE learns a latent representation of the data and can generate novel anime faces by sampling from this latent space. This repository provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the VAE and generate anime faces.
